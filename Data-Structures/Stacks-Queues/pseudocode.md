# SNHU Data Structures and Algorithms for Stacks and Queues

## What is a Stack?

An **L**ast **I**n **F**irst **O**ut (LIFO) abstract data type structure. The Last element added to the stack will be the first element removed from the stack.

i.e. A stack of plates, or a stack of markers

As you pile up the last thing (or topmost item) is what gets removed first.

### Useful Stack applications

- Managing function invocations
- Undo/Redo functionality
- Routing
